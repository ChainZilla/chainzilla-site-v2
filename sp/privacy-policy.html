										<h6>Information We Automatically Collect </h6>

Your IP address will not be used to track or identify you, but may be used to determine your geographic location in order to determine which of our services you are presented with. Users of our website or mobile applications will receive an anonymous unique device id (“UDID”) for the purpose of identifying the device to ChainZilla service servers. This UDID will not be tied to users’ identities, but will be used for debugging purposes and to differentiate devices when users access our Services using multiple devices.</p>
										<h6>Third Party Services</h6>
										<p>Certain features on ChainZilla service rely on various third-party products and services (collectively “Third Party Services”), such as the Ethereum network, Google Analytics, Apple’s application platform, Coinbase, Changelly, Fabric, and Shapeshift.

									<h5>ONLINE TRACKING AND HOW WE RESPOND TO DO NOT TRACK SIGNALS</h5>
								</div>
								<div class="acc-content">
									<p>Online tracking is the collection of data about an individual’s Internet activity used to deliver targeted advertisements and for other purposes. Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome) incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) or similar feature that signals to websites that a visitor does not want to have his/her online activity and behavior tracked. If an online service elects to respond to a particular DNT signal, the service may refrain from collecting certain personal information about the browser’s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and there is currently no industry consensus as to what constitutes a DNT signal. For these reasons, many website operators, including ChainZilla, do not take action to respond to DNT signals. For more information about DNT signals, visit <a href="http://allaboutdnt.com">http://allaboutdnt.com</a>.</p>
