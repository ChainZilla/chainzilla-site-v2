									<h5>THE BLOCKCHAIN SERVICES</h5>
								</div>
								<div class="acc-content">
									<p>Chameleon Pay is software that <br>(a) generates Wallet addresses and encrypted private keys that you may use to send and receive cryptocurrencies and related cryptographically secured tokens (the “Virtual Currency”); <br>(b) allows users to browse third party decentralized applications (“DApps” or “DApp”) through the mobile application’s DApp browser; and <br>(c) facilitates the submission of Virtual Currency transaction data to Ethereum-based blockchains (the “Ethereum Networks”) without requiring you to download or install the associated Ethereum-based software to your local device. </p>
									<p>Wallet Address, Private Key, and Backup Capabilities. An encrypted backup of certain information associated with the Wallet can be stored on your device in an encrypted format. The private key is connected to the Wallet address and, together, they can be used to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency to and from that Wallet address. You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your private key and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet.</p>
									<p>You must keep your Wallet address, 12 word mnemonic (backup) seed, and private key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the Wallet.</p>
									<p>ChainZilla Cannot Assist With Password Retrieval. Chameleon Pay stores your Wallet address but does not receive or store your Wallet password, encrypted private key, unencrypted private key, or mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet. We cannot, therefore, assist you with Wallet password retrieval. We cannot generate a new password for your Wallet if you fail to remember your original password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet address and private key pairs maintained in your Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such a Wallet address will become inaccessible if you do not have your Wallet password.</p>
									<p>Virtual Currency Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency’s associated public blockchain. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by independent third parties, which we do not own, control, or operate. We have no control over the any of the blockchain Networks and, therefore, cannot and do not ensure that any transaction details that you submit via our Services will be confirmed and processed. By using ChainZilla services, you acknowledge and agree that the transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the respective blockchain Networks.</p>
									<p>ChainZilla Does Not Store or Transmit Virtual Currency. We do not store, send, or receive Virtual Currency. Any transfer that occurs in any Virtual Currency occurs on the respective blockchains and not on a network owned by us. We therefore do not guarantee that ChainZilla services can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency. Accuracy of Information Provided by User. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept and acknowledge that we are not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction initiated via the Services. We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer a Virtual Currency. </p>

								<div class="acc-title">
									<h5>WALLET REGISTRATION AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h5>
								</div>
								<div class="acc-content">
									<p>You must either import or create a Wallet in order to use Chameleon Pay. When you create a Wallet, you will be assigned a private key. You will be prompted to save a 12 word mnemonic seed which lets you recover your funds on a BIP39 compatible wallet. You will be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your private key and seed, and will be fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorized use of your password, account, or any other breach of security. </p>
									<p>We will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this paragraph. When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take precautions in order to avoid loss of access to and/or control over your Wallet. Suggested measures include, but are not limited to, the following: <br>(a) creating a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; <br>(b) using the backup functionality provided by the Wallet or safeguard your private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase on an external hard drive which, all users, especially users who have more than $5,000 USD in assets, are encouraged to move funds to a cold storage wallet even if they are utilizing the Services’ backup functionality; <br>(c) maintaining the security of your Wallet by protecting the private key and mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with your Wallet by, for example, limiting access to your computer and your Wallet; and <br>(d) promptly notifying us if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related to your Wallet. </p>
									<p>Push Notifications. You may agree to receive push notifications from ChainZilla that will alert you when there’s activity in the wallet or news. Push notifications can be enabled to display information about special news, offers, airdrops, and other rewards. If you would like to receive push notifications, you must opt in to the service by accessing “Settings” and enabling “Push Notifications”.</p>
									<p>Payment and Fees. ChainZilla does not currently charge any fees for any of its Services. However, we reserve the right to do so and, in such case, any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any service to which a fee applies.</p>
									<p>Transactions. Once transaction details have been submitted via the Services, we cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction. ChainZilla has no control over any blockchain networks and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests. You must ensure that you have an adequate balance in your Wallet and/or gas to complete transactions before initiating a transaction. You acknowledge and agree that we will not be liable for any failed transactions due to insufficient funds or gas associated with your ChainZilla account.</p>
									<p>Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions that you have submitted transaction details for via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that we are not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your blockchain based transactions or for collecting, reporting, withholding, or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency-related transactions.</p>
