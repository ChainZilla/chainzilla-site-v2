									<p>Any token, network or token sale information accessed by you via the Services is provided for information purposes only and is not intended to constitute the offering of securities or regulated investments or advice, promotion, invitation or solicitation for regulated investment or securities purposes by ChainZilla. You must obtain professional or specialist advice or carry out your own due diligence before taking, or refraining from taking, any action on the basis of the content of our Services. In most cases the Services contain information on token sales or exchange events that are entirely unrelated to ChainZilla and for which ChainZilla has no involvement in (including any technical structuring or promotion). Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information on our Services, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that the content on our Services is accurate, complete or up to date. For a detailed summary of the various risks involved in token sales and the related technologies please see our Sector Risk Warning page. In some cases a token offer may be brought to you in association with ChainZilla. If this is the case, this will be flagged on our token sale webpage. Whilst we take care to try to ensure that the persons involved in token sales with which we are associated, and that the proposed technology base for the token is credible, we do not warrant that the information provided in the token sale documentation is accurate nor that the proposed token will function as intended or expected or that they will be fit for any particular purpose. Prospective contributors are advised that they must carry out their own research on the people, technology, business plan and use cases of the proposed network and token. Any terms and conditions entered into by contributors in respect of the acquisition of tokens are between them and the issuer of the token and ChainZilla is not the seller of such tokens. ChainZilla has no legal responsibility for any representations made by third parties in respect of any token sale and any claim for breach of contract must also be made directly against the token issuing entity listed therein. Where ChainZilla is associated with a project, its role can include providing services such as white paper review, market conduct insights, marketing and technical insights, token functionality and economics, creation and distribution of token, smart contract creation, multisignature wallet, widgets for white label implementation, PR and marketing management with customer, social media and forum management with customer, feature of client in newsletter and website. Each token project is different and the need for ChainZilla services varies. ChainZilla receives compensation from the token project for the provision of the services. The exact nature of the compensation varies. Depending on project and stage of the token sale ChainZilla receives a fixed fee and/or a percentage fee based on the volume of the sale. The average size of the total compensation is a high to low single digit percentage. The fee paid is paid in the currency of the token sale or in the token itself.</p>
